## Pi one-time set up
Set up pi to use our local network:
a. Plug in/turn on pi
b. Wait a few minutes; connect to "Maestro" wifi network that appears.
c. Go to http://flipdots.local/admin
d. Update SSID/password to local wifi network
e. Connect to local (same) wifi network!

Now what? SSH to it!
1. ` ssh pi@flipdots.local`
2. pw: `flipdots`

Then change time via config: `sudo raspi-config`
